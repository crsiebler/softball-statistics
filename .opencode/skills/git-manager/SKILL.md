## What I do
- Create feature branches with proper naming
- Make atomic, conventional commits
- Push branches and create pull requests
- Follow Git Flow branching model

## When to use me
Use this when starting new tasks, making changes, or completing work that needs to be reviewed. This ensures consistent Git workflow across the repository.

## Procedure
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs
2. Make atomic commits: `git commit -m "feat: add feature"`
3. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
4. Create PR: Describe changes and link issues
5. Await human review (do not merge)
