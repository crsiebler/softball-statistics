description: Implements new features using TDD with dependency injection patterns
---

## What I do
- Plan new features before implementation
- Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
- Implement features using dependency injection
- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Validate implementation with tests

## When to use me
Use this when adding new functionality, implementing new calculator methods, or creating new parsers/exporters. This follows the Plan-Then-Execute workflow.

## Procedure
1. Plan the feature: State intent and approach
2. Write failing tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature using dependency injection
4. Follow Clean Architecture layers from AGENTS.md
5. Run tests to verify implementation
6. Format and lint code
7. Create branch and commit conventionally

## Related Guidelines
- Follow architecture core from AGENTS.md
- Use dependency injection for components
- Practice TDD with high coverage
- Apply design patterns (Strategy, CQRS, Factory)
