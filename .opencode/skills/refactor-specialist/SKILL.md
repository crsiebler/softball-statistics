description: Applies design patterns and maintains architectural boundaries during refactoring

## What I do
- Analyze current architecture for improvement opportunities
- Apply design patterns (Strategy, CQRS, Factory)
- Maintain dependency injection and repository patterns
- Ensure business logic stays isolated
- Validate changes with full test suite

## When to use me
Use this when refactoring code to improve maintainability, applying patterns, or restructuring to follow Clean Architecture. This preserves architectural boundaries while improving code quality.

## Procedure
1. Analyze current architecture and identify improvements
2. Plan refactoring: State intent and approach
3. Apply appropriate design patterns from AGENTS.md
4. Maintain dependency injection and repository patterns
5. Ensure business logic stays isolated in calculators/
6. Run full test suite to verify no regressions
7. Format and lint changes

## Related Guidelines
- Follow system structure from AGENTS.md
- Apply design patterns appropriately
- Maintain Clean Architecture layers
- Preserve testing standards and coverage
